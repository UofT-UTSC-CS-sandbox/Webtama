- Description of the web application

This web application will allow users to keep track of games they have played and plan on playing, as well as being able to view game titles and see other users reviews or discussion forums about the game. Accounts would be connected through email which would allow emails to be sent regarding new games, recommendations, etc. The games would be handled by a global database that kept track of global review score and details about each game, and each user would have a collection of games that would have additional attributes such as personal score, status (plan to play, playing, complete) and potentially others.

- What complexity points will this project contain
